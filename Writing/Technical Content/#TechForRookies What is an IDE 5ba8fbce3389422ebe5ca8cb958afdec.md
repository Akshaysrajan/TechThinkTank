# #TechForRookies: What is an IDE?

There is no shortage of acronyms thrown around when you first start talking tech — however, I have to admit that this one was something I didn’t understand for a while. I had simply let the term wash over me, and had no idea it meant something I was already working with.

So, what’s an IDE?

It’s an editor. For code.

The end.

Well it sounds pretty simple, Right ? Well It Is And It Isn’t :P. So To Get Into The Detail:

With a little more detail, **IDE** stands for **Integrated Development Environment.** Literally, a bit of software which is Integrated into your computer, used for code Development, and it’s a virtual Environment in which to do that.

There are a range of IDE’s out there — just like there being a difference between deciding whether to write an essay in **Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Pages**, etc. An IDE is fundamentally the window which hosts the text of whatever you are coding.

Many developers will have a preferred set of IDE’s or even a preferred single IDE, depending on the languages they work with. For example, **IntelliJ** is great for Java, VS Code is very versatile for front-end, PyCharm was developed with Python coding in mind. They usually have some nifty add-ons and integrations to flag errors, integrate with Git (more on that later) and customise the display (most hardcore devs use dark mode, to avoid eye strain).

A side note: Google CloudShell and CodePen are not technically IDE’s as they are in-browser, but they are great if you aren’t able to download any software to your computer!

So, when you hear the term IDE being thrown around, think of it as a text editor for code, with a few bells and whistles (if you think spellcheck is good, just wait for the hints and flagging some IDE’s provide). Once you understand that, you’re talking tech!

Also, Since JavaScript Is A Pretty Popular Language Among The Developer Community, Some Of The Most Popular JavaScript IDE’s Are As Follows :
