Choosing which programming language to use on a project can be a daunting task. You have an idea in mind but what path would get you to implement it in the easiest way?! 
<br><br>
Some languages(and frameworks!) are a better fit for projects than others.
<br><br>
Some factors to consider before choosing the best language are -
### 1.Familiarity
How well versed are you in the programming language? (This becomes more important as the deadlines get closer)
### 2.Type of Application
Web applications, mobile applications, embedded firmware, etc. – the type of application you’re developing heavily influences what languages are available for us to choose from. General programming languages like Java, JavaScript, Python and C# can build different types of applications on different platforms. There are also cases where specific languages work better. For example, building a native Android app requires knowledge of Java, building a native iOS app requires a Swift or Objective-C skill set, whereas knowledge of C or C++ is critical if you’re working with embedded firmware.
### 3.How many people actually code in it? This is important if you need help!
It’s one thing to be able to find work with a language—it’s another to actually enjoy working with one. So, how do these languages stack up? Stack Overflow’s 2017 survey included a scale of developers’ most loved and most dreaded languages, where “loved” meant developers work with a language and want to continue doing so, and “dreaded” meant people work with a language and don’t want to keep using it. Comparing the languages devs least enjoyed with the top five for working opportunities, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, and PHP were in the top 20 most dreaded languages. C# and Python didn’t make the top 20 at all.
### 4.Their job prospects and salary expectations-
If you look into programming language popularity, you’ll see a pretty wide range of languages depending on where you look. But one thing they almost all have in common is that C# and Java are typically in the top five.
