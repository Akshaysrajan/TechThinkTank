Contributing to open source isnâ€™t just for technical folks who want to write code. There are lots of opportunities to use your professional skills in support of open-source projects. This year we at Owasp are encouraging contributions not only in Technical domain but also in non or low code domain. No matter your experience you can contribute into this repo and participate in Hacktoberfest.

Low code contributions are fantastic choices for folks who don't have a lot of technical knowledge. Here are some examples of ways you can contribute to open-source projects:

## Writing
A contributor can contribute in the writing section by contributing a Technical content,blog or case study on any technical topic or domain.

### Structure
A contributor need to go to Writing dir and create a new file in the section they want to contribute, the content should be in the form of Markdown and should strictly follow the format structure, along with supporting links.

### Format
```
    Title/Heading of the Content/Blog

    Body(Containing Sub-heading and bullet points to make the content attractive.)

    Supporting Links
```

## Design
